        <h2>About the Robinsons</h2>
        <p className="robinsons">The Robinson Family<br/></p>
        <p className="family">Four30 Scones is a family owned business.  Shane and Renee started the business in 2016 by selling their scones at farmers markets, popup markets and wholesaling to local coffee shops in Central Illinois.  
          It became a family affair with their children selling on the weekends and in the summers helping in the commercial kitchen they rented. 
          The demand and business grew and in 2019 they purchased an old Speedy Lube that they renovated and is now open as a scone shop with coffee and a drive through!  
          The Robison’s hope to serve the Morton community and beyond well.  They are proud of their town and hope to see the business community thrive and grow.</p>
 
        <p className="robinsons">Our Name<br/></p>
        <p className="family">The name Four30 Scones came from Shane + Renee’s anniversary, April 30th.  
          It has been a collaboration of both their passions: business, design and food. 
          It has been a dream come true to build this business together and they look forward to serving the community!</p>
